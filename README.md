# FIFAWC22
Using FIFA-data to build best XI
Took FIFA 22 dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stefanoleone992/fifa-22-complete-player-dataset) to analyze best starting Eleven for the upcoming
World CUp in Qatar.
I just started learning about Python some months ago so I always appreciate comments and recommendations for improvements.
